# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of developing, designing, maintaining and testing software applications.
It is important in that it enables the creation of software applications and systems useful in our day to day lives, for example healthcare, entertainment and communication.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages, for example C
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirement - identify the final user specification. 
design - building the framework. 
implementation - converting software design into tangible code
testing - examine the software to ensure it meets the quality standards and functionality requirements
deployment - releasing software to users
maintenance - providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology has limited flexibility while agile methodology is very flexible.
Waterfall is a linear sequential process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next while Agile involnes sprints where small increments of functionality are delivered and refined based on feedback.
In waterfall, customer feedback is  gathered at the end of the developmentprocess while in Agile, customer collaboration is continuous throughout the project.
Waterfall is used in projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes.
Agile is used in projects with evolving requirements and needs.




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer  is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
A quality assurance engineer ensures software quaity by designing and executing test plans.
A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software applications.





Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide software tools for writing, debugging and testing code, for example visual studio code
VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and cordinating work among team members, for example Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
CHALLENGES:
Changing of requrements during the develpment cycle leading to project delays
Rushed development and compromised quality of software due to tight deadlines
Technical debt accruing from shortcuts, impeding future development efforts and increasing maintenance costs.

STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES:
Effective communication
Agile methodologies
Prioritization of tasks
Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing - tests individual modules of software
integration testing- tests the interaction between different components of a software
system testing - tests the software system as a whole
acceptance testing - tests the software against consumer requirements to ensure it caters for their needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of writing instructions to artificial intelligence models to produce a specific output.
Prompt engineering is aimed at receiving clear responses from AI models by providing clear, specific, concise and complete instructions.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Draw two cars
Improved prompt: Draw a red Ford Raptor R with tinted windows parked outside a Mansion alongside a white Mercedes G Wagon on a well trimmed lawn.
The improved prompt is more effective since the instructions are clearer, more specific and concise.
